Advanced Predictive Analytics: HR Insights & Time-Series ForecastingThis repository showcases advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques applied to two distinct domains: Human Resources (Employee Attrition) and Demographic Time-Series forecasting.Project OverviewThe project is divided into two primary analytical frameworks:1. HR Data Analytics & Employee Turnover PredictionUsing a comprehensive HR dataset, this module aims to predict employee attrition ("left" column) by analyzing workplace factors and satisfaction levels.Analytical Depth: Includes detailed Statistical Summary, handling of missing values, and duplicate detection.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of feature distributions, correlation matrices, and addressing class imbalance problems.Modeling Suite: Comparative analysis using multiple algorithms:Logistic RegressionDecision TreesNaive BayesXGBoost (High-performance gradient boosting)Evaluation: Comprehensive reporting using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrices.2. Time-Series Forecasting with Deep LearningThis module focuses on predicting population dynamics (POP dataset) using state-of-the-art neural forecasting architectures.Architecture: Implementation of the NHITS (Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series) model.Framework: Built using the neuralforecast library.Process: * Data windowing and horizon ($H$) definition.Model fitting with multi-step-ahead forecasting.Visualization of "Real vs. Forecasted" values to validate model accuracy.Technical StackCore Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (Interactive plots).Boosting: XGBoost.Deep Learning (Forecasting): NeuralForecast (NHITS model).Key Competencies DemonstratedSupervised Learning: Building robust classification pipelines for organizational decision-making.Deep Learning for Time Series: Applying hierarchical neural networks to capture complex seasonal patterns and trends.Data Engineering: Preprocessing raw CSV data into model-ready tensors and features.Model Optimization: Tuning hyperparameters and comparing diverse algorithmic approaches.Installation & UsageClone the repository.Install dependencies: pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost neuralforecast matplotlib seaborn.Open pythonpracticalexam2-2.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab to see the full execution and results.
